Unindent Preprocessor
=====================

A plugin for Sublime Text for automatically unindenting the line when inserting a preprocessor directive in the [Objective]C/C++ code.

The plugin automatically unindents the line on pressing the '#' character if the cursor is preceded by a whitespace only.

## Installation

The easiest and recommended way to install is through [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/) plugin. Once it's installed, restart Sublime Text and press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on Windows/Linux or <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> on OS X to bring up the Command Pallete. From there look for **Install Package** and then for **UnindentPreprocessor**. Package Control will keep the plugin up to date automatically.

Otherwise it can be installed by cloning this repo while inside Sublime's **Packages** directory.
